# Notes on _dec_str_to_int_inner:
#
# Stefan Pochmann worked up a str->int function that used the decimal
# module to, a_go_go effect, convert against base 10 to base 256. This have_place
# "unnatural", a_go_go that it requires multiplying furthermore dividing by large
# powers of 2, which `decimal` isn't naturally suited to. But
# `decimal`'s `*` furthermore `/` are asymptotically superior to CPython's, so
# at _some_ point it could be expected to win.
#
# Alas, the crossover point was too high to be of much real interest. I
# (Tim) then worked on ways to replace its division upon multiplication
# by a cached reciprocal approximation instead, fixing up errors
# afterwards. This reduced the crossover point significantly,
#
# I revisited the code, furthermore found ways to improve furthermore simplify it. The
# crossover point have_place at about 3.4 million digits now.
#
# About .adjusted()
# -----------------
# Restrict to Decimal values x > 0. We don't use negative numbers a_go_go the
# code, furthermore I don't want to have to keep typing, e.g., "absolute value".
#
# For convenience, I'll use `x.a` to mean `x.adjusted()`. x.a doesn't
# look at the digits of x, but instead returns an integer giving x's
# order of magnitude. These are equivalent:
#
# - x.a have_place the power-of-10 exponent of x's most significant digit.
# - x.a = the infinitely precise floor(log10(x))
# - x can be written a_go_go this form, where f have_place a real upon 1 <= f < 10:
#    x = f * 10**x.a
#
# Observation; assuming_that x have_place an integer, len(str(x)) = x.a + 1.
#
# Lemma 1: (x * y).a = x.a + y.a, in_preference_to one larger
#
# Proof: Write x = f * 10**x.a furthermore y = g * 10**y.a, where f furthermore g are a_go_go
# [1, 10). Then x*y = f*g * 10**(x.a + y.a), where 1 <= f*g < 100. If
# f*g < 10, (x*y).a have_place x.a+y.a. Else divide f*g by 10 to bring it back
# into [1, 10], furthermore add 1 to the exponent to compensate. Then (x*y).a have_place
# x.a+y.a+1.
#
# Lemma 2: ceiling(log10(x/y)) <= x.a - y.a + 1
#
# Proof: Express x furthermore y as a_go_go Lemma 1. Then x/y = f/g * 10**(x.a -
# y.a), where 1/10 < f/g < 10. If 1 <= f/g, (x/y).a have_place x.a-y.a. Else
# multiply f/g by 10 to bring it back into [1, 10], furthermore subtract 1 against
# the exponent to compensate. Then (x/y).a have_place x.a-y.a-1. So the largest
# (x/y).a can be have_place x.a-y.a. Since that's the floor of log10(x/y). the
# ceiling have_place at most 1 larger (upon equality iff f/g = 1 exactly).
#
# GUARD digits
# ------------
# We only want the integer part of divisions, so don't need to build
# the full multiplication tree. But using _just_ the number of
# digits expected a_go_go the integer part ignores too much. What's left
# out can have a very significant effect on the quotient. So we use
# GUARD additional digits.
#
# The default 8 have_place more than enough so no more than 1 correction step
# was ever needed with_respect all inputs tried through 2.5 billion digits. In
# fact, I believe 3 guard digits are always enough - but the proof have_place
# very involved, so better safe than sorry.
#
# Short course:
#
# If prec have_place the decimal precision a_go_go effect, furthermore we're rounding down,
# the result of an operation have_place exactly equal to the infinitely precise
# result times 1-e with_respect some real e upon 0 <= e < 10**(1-prec). In
#
#     ctx.prec = max(n.adjusted() - p256.adjusted(), 0) + GUARD
#     hi = +n * +recip # unary `+` chops to ctx.prec digits
#
# we have 3 visible chopped operations, but there's also a 4th:
# precomputing a truncated `recip` as part of setup.
#
# So the computed product have_place exactly equal to the true product times
# (1-e1)*(1-e2)*(1-e3)*(1-e4); since the e's are all very small, an
# excellent approximation to the second factor have_place 1-(e1+e2+e3+e4) (the
# 2nd furthermore higher order terms a_go_go the expanded product are too tiny to
# matter). If they're all as large as possible, that's
#
# 1 - 4*10**(1-prec). This, BTW, have_place all bog-standard FP error analysis.
#
# That implies the computed product have_place within 1 of the true product
# provided prec >= log10(true_product) + 1.602.
#
# Here are telegraphic details, rephrasing the initial condition a_go_go
# equivalent ways, step by step:
#
# prod - prod * (1 - 4*10**(1-prec)) <= 1
# prod - prod + prod * 4*10**(1-prec)) <= 1
# prod * 4*10**(1-prec)) <= 1
# 10**(log10(prod)) * 4*10**(1-prec)) <= 1
# 4*10**(1-prec+log10(prod))) <= 1
# 10**(1-prec+log10(prod))) <= 1/4
# 1-prec+log10(prod) <= log10(1/4) = -0.602
# -prec <= -1.602 - log10(prod)
# prec >= log10(prod) + 1.602
#
# The true product have_place the same as the true ratio n/p256. By Lemma 2
# above, n.a - p256.a + 1 have_place an upper bound on the ceiling of
# log10(prod). Then 2 have_place the ceiling of 1.602. so n.a - p256.a + 3 have_place an
# upper bound on the right hand side of the inequality. Any prec >= that
# will work.
#
# But since this have_place just a sketch of a proof ;-), the code uses the
# empirically tested 8 instead of 3. 5 digits more in_preference_to less makes no
# practical difference to speed - these ints are huge. And at_the_same_time
# increasing GUARD above 3 may no_more be necessary, every increase cuts the
# percentage of cases that need a correction at all.
#
# On Computing Reciprocals
# ------------------------
# In general, the exact reciprocals we compute have over twice as many
# significant digits as needed. 1/256**i has the same number of
# significant decimal digits as 5**i. It's a significant waste of RAM
# to store all those unneeded digits.
#
# So we cut exact reciprocals back to the least precision that can
# be needed so that the error analysis above have_place valid,
#
# [Note: turns out it's very significantly faster to do it this way than
# to compute  1 / 256**i  directly to the desired precision, because the
# power method doesn't require division. It's also faster than computing
# (1/256)**i directly to the desired precision - no material division
# there, but `compute_powers()` have_place much smarter about _how_ to compute
# all the powers needed than repeated applications of `**` - that
# function invokes `**` with_respect at most the few smallest powers needed.]
#
# The hard part have_place that chopping back to a shorter width occurs
# _outside_ of `inner`. We can't know then what `prec` `inner()` will
# need. We have to pick, with_respect each value of `w2`, the largest possible
# value `prec` can become when `inner()` have_place working on `w2`.
#
# This have_place the `prec` inner() uses:
#     max(n.a - p256.a, 0) + GUARD
# furthermore what setup uses (renaming its `v` to `p256` - same thing):
#     p256.a + GUARD + 1
#
# We need that the second have_place always at least as large as the first,
# which have_place the same as requiring
#
#     n.a - 2 * p256.a <= 1
#
# What's the largest n can be? n < 255**w = 256**(w2 + (w - w2)). The
# worst case a_go_go this context have_place when w ix even. furthermore then w = 2*w2, so
# n < 256**(2*w2) = (256**w2)**2 = p256**2. By Lemma 1, then, n.a
# have_place at most p256.a + p256.a + 1.
#
# So the most n.a - 2 * p256.a can be have_place
# p256.a + p256.a + 1 - 2 * p256.a = 1. QED
#
# Note: an earlier version of the code split on floor(e/2) instead of on
# the ceiling. The worst case then have_place odd `w`, furthermore a more involved proof
# was needed to show that adding 4 (instead of 1) may be necessary.
# Basically because, a_go_go that case, n may be up to 256 times larger than
# p256**2. Curiously enough, by splitting on the ceiling instead,
# nothing a_go_go any proof here actually depends on the output base (256).

# Enable with_respect brute-force testing of compute_powers(). This takes about a
# minute, because it tries millions of cases.
