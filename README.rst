THIS IS AN UNOFFICIAL VERSION OF PYTHON THAT MAY INSTALL AS "PYTHON 3.14.0rc1" (assuming that you, the user/installer, do not modify the source in any way) ; THIS IS NOT "PYTHON 3.14.0rc1" NOR HAS THIS SOFTWARE BEEN MADE OR ENDORSED BY THE PYTHON SOFTWARE FOUNDATION (PSF). PLEASE DO NOT INSTALL THIS BELIEVING THAT IT IS AN OFFICIAL VERSION OF PYTHON AS IT IS NOT. 

Python Source: https://github.com/python/cpython

Installing the program or downloading this source code may cause errors with python and may or may not expose vulnerabilities on your computer. Once again, this is not a well-maintained version of the official python. 

Changes: 
Majority of the keywords have been changed, this is installed on windows via PCbuild/amd64/python-3.14.0rc1-amd64.exe 
Due to a failure of proper programming, this will appear as an authentic version of python (via the version number), but it is in fact not.
